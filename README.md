This our second game in series on the ZkNoid platform.\
This game (Power Clash) is an interesting version of Rock-Paper-Scissor game, In this game we are using 5 objects Dynamite-Alien-Cockroach-Water_wave-Sponge.\
In this game we used many inbuilt libraries of zknoid SDK that are like: I+we used matchmaker for match making between players, used lobby for lobby creation, its runtimeModule, its stateMap for storing the states, we implemented commit-reveal-scheme by using Poseidon and Provable from o1js library.
